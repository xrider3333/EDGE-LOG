## 0. TL;DR — where we stand

- **Deployable config is settled and triple-validated** (walk-forward, lockbox, ES transfer):
  **single lot · OR=1 · Both · stop 0.75 · vol 1.25 · ride-to-close · flat EOD · 5-bar trailing stop.**
  = `ORB_3_1.py` at `partial_exit_R=0, trail_bars=5`. Saved as **run #125** (starred).
- **The trailing stop is the whole game.** It halves drawdown (−$26k → −$9k) and doubles MAR
  (15 → 33) vs no trail, for ~25% less gross PnL — which you *make back and more* by sizing up.
- **The 2-lot "book early" partial is optional** — it lifts win-rate (→50-60%) but not MAR. Psychology lever, not an edge lever.
- **Smarter trails were tested and lost:** chandelier ATR trail overfits (great in-sample, worse on lockbox); activation hurts; breakeven@1R is a wash. Simple fixed bar-trail wins forward.
- **Edge is structural:** the NQ config transfers to ES with no re-fit (ES lockbox PF 1.57).
- **Vol-target (risk-parity) sizing is a modest but GENERALIZING win** (unlike the chandelier):
  size ∝ 1/initial-risk lifts lockbox MAR +29% (6.9 → 8.9) and roughly halves drawdown, at the
  cost of absolute PnL at equal average size (you recover it by sizing up into the freed DD budget).
  Best practical form: **risk-parity capped at 3× avg size (`rp-cap3`)**, applied at the execution layer.
- **ML gate does NOT earn its keep on ORB** (per ROADMAP #25) — ORB is already clean/high-volume. Keep the gate for marginal strategies (VWAP FADE), not ORB.

- **Best result — the sizing overlay (§4.7/4.10/4.11):** THREE independent edges *stack* into one
  execution-layer size rule — **risk-parity** (∝1/stop) **× time-tilt** (~2× the morning PF window)
  **× short-tilt** (shorts carry the edge; longs are ~deadweight, PF 1.03 vs 2.74, confirmed on ES).
  Capital-matched, the full stack lifts lockbox MAR **6.9 → 15.0 (+118%)**, PF 1.63 → 2.85, winning
  5/6 WF folds. No entry/exit change (§5.6 deploy rule). *Tilt, don't cut* — truncation/short-only balloon DD.
- Consolidated into reusable code (item F): `augur_engine/sizing.py` + `tools/orb_edge_report.py`.

**Next up: the edge-hunting is done. Ship it — wire the sizing overlay + MAR column into the app (owner-reviewed, changes core PnL semantics), or deploy as-is.** *(E: ride+trailed ensemble = minor smoothing.)*
*(Tested & rejected: smarter trailing (chandelier/activate/breakeven), regime skip `atr_filter`, midday time-stop, morning-only truncation — the trail already handles low-vol/stalled trades; truncation balloons drawdown.)*

## 4. Results (measured)

### 4.1 The original question — 119 (safe) vs 121 (aggressive)
Same strategy, different knobs. 119 = 0.75 stop / 4.5R cap / holds overnight → smooth, small.
121 = 0.25 stop / ride-to-close / flat EOD → big PnL but **0.25 is below the 0.5 floor, so its
$615k/PF2.50 was partly a fill artifact.** A safe 0.75 stop with ride-to-close still nets ~$407k
→ the underlying edge is real; the tight stop inflated it.

### 4.2 Exit-lever frontier (full pre-lockbox sweep, MAR-ranked)
The single-lot no-trail config wins on **PnL**; a trail wins on **risk-adjusted return**:

| partial / trail | net $ | WR | PF | maxDD | MAR |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| p0 / **t5** | $307k | 41% | 1.61 | −$9.4k | **32.8** ← risk-adj champ |
| p0 / t8 | $310k | 37% | 1.59 | −$9.6k | 32.2 |
| p3.0 / t5 | $348k | 44% | 1.44 | −$15.9k | 21.9 |
| p2.0 / t0 | $354k | 50% | 1.50 | −$22.3k | 15.9 |
| p0 / t0 (single lot) | **$407k** | 38% | 1.49 | −$26.4k | 15.4 ← PnL champ |

Trail (t3/t5/t8) tops the MAR frontier → it's a **plateau, not a spike** (robust). Partial only raises WR.

### 4.3 Walk-forward (expanding window, 6 folds, pre-lockbox)
- PnL-ranked: **6/6 folds OOS-positive**, OOS total $391k. Per-fold champ mostly single-lot.
- MAR-ranked: **6/6 folds OOS-positive**, OOS total $287k. Per-fold champ mostly p0 + trail.

### 4.4 Lockbox one-shot (unseen last 12 mo) — **PASS**
| config | net $ | WR | PF | maxDD | MAR |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| p0/t0 (PnL champ) | $84.6k | 40% | 1.59 | −$17.1k | 4.96 |
| **p0/t5 (deployable)** | $54.1k | 40% | **1.63** | −$7.9k | **6.88** |

### 4.5 Trailing research (ORB 3.2) — smarter trail LOSES to simple
| variant | in-sample MAR | lockbox PF | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| bar-trail 5 (baseline) | 32.8 | **1.63** | robust winner |
| chandelier 0.15×ATR | **38.9** (best in-sample) | 1.45 | **OVERFIT** — worse OOS |
| bar-trail 5 + breakeven@1R | 34.1 | — | mild in-sample only |
| bar-trail 5 + activate@1R | worse DD | — | hurts (give-back) |

*(Chandelier is scaled in session-range units, so multipliers are small ~0.15, not the 2.5-4 a bar-ATR chandelier uses.)*

### 4.6 ES transfer (NQ config, no re-fit) — **PASS**
| window | net $ | WR | PF | maxDD | MAR |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ES full | $186.7k | 39% | 1.47 | −$7.4k | 25.4 |
| ES lockbox (unseen) | $26.7k | 33% | **1.57** | −$5.4k | 4.97 |

Edge holds on a sibling instrument it was never fit to → **structural**, not an NQ artifact.

### 4.7 Vol-target (risk-parity) sizing — modest, and it GENERALIZES ✅
Re-weight position size ∝ 1/initial-risk (constant-$ risk per trade) vs fixed 1 contract,
capital-matched (mean size = 1), fee scales with size. `rp-cap3` = risk-parity capped at 3× avg;
`rp-sqrt` = dampened (size ∝ 1/√risk).

| window | scheme | net $ | PF | maxDD | MAR |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| full | fixed (baseline) | $360.6k | 1.61 | −$9.35k | 38.6 |
| full | rp-cap3 | $188.8k | 1.73 | −$4.26k | 44.3 |
| full | rp-sqrt | $255.9k | 1.67 | −$5.02k | **50.9** |
| **lockbox** | fixed | $54.1k | 1.63 | −$7.87k | 6.88 |
| **lockbox** | **rp-cap3** | $55.2k | 1.72 | −$6.24k | **8.85** (+29%) |

- Improves MAR on full history (38.6 → 44-51), the unseen lockbox (6.9 → 8.9), and **4 of 6 WF folds**.
  Cuts drawdown ~in half; lifts PF (1.61 → 1.73). **Survives the lockbox** — a real edge, not a mirage.
- Costs absolute PnL *at equal average size* because it downsizes the wide-OR trend days that make the
  fat tail. On a **drawdown budget** (size up to the old DD) rp-sqrt ≈ **+32% return** at equal risk.
- Best practical: **`rp-cap3`**. It's a sizing OVERLAY at the execution layer (contracts per signal),
  not a signal change — see the deploy rule in §5.6 below.
- Caveats: realize it via whole-contract rounding (cleaner on micros/larger accounts); risk-parity
  concentrates size into quiet-day tight-stop trades (the cap + the 1.25 vol filter mitigate the tail).

### 4.8 Regime skip (`atr_filter`) — NO help on the trailed base ✗
Sweep of `atr_filter` (skip a session whose recent 5-session avg range < x × trailing-60 median),
deployable p0/trail5, pre-lockbox, net:

| atr_filter | trades | net $ | PF | maxDD | MAR |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **0.0 (off)** | 3,814 | $306.5k | 1.61 | −$9.35k | **32.8** |
| 0.6 | 3,713 | $294.1k | 1.59 | −$9.35k | 31.5 |
| 0.8 | 3,120 | $232.9k | 1.54 | −$12.46k | 18.7 |
| 1.0 | 2,116 | $142.0k | 1.46 | −$11.31k | 12.6 |

- **Every filter > 0 lowers MAR, PF, and net $; drawdown doesn't improve (gets *worse* at 0.8+).**
  Best value is OFF. Same verdict on lockbox + 0/6 WF folds (best filter = 0.0, so identical to baseline).
- **Why:** the regime report flagged low-vol days as ORB's bleeding bucket on an **untrailed** config.
  The 5-bar trailing stop already exits the quiet-day chop fast, so those days aren't bleeding anymore —
  skipping them just removes trades (some are winners) and *concentrates* the remaining drawdown.
  **Regime-skip and the trail are substitutes, not complements.** Leave `atr_filter = 0`.

### 4.9 Time structure — time-stop ✗, but entry-time reveals a real edge signal ◐
Two session-clock levers (`ORB_3_3.py`, 5m RTH: bar t ≈ 9:30 + 5·t min), net of fees:

**Midday time-stop (force-exit at session-bar X) — REJECTED.** Every setting worsens it:
| time_stop_bar | net $ | PF | maxDD | MAR |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 (off) | $306.5k | 1.61 | −$9.35k | 32.8 |
| 48 (~13:30) | $260.5k | 1.54 | −$13.7k | 19.0 |
Same story as regime-skip: the trailing stop already exits stalled trades; a hard time-exit just cuts winners.

**Entry-time cutoff (only enter before session-bar X) — a real QUALITY signal that generalizes:**
| cutoff | window | trades | net $ | PF | maxDD | MAR |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 (all day) | — | 3,814 | $306.5k | 1.61 | −$9.35k | **32.8** |
| 6 | first 30 min | 438 | $56.6k | **2.45** | −$4.65k | 12.2 |
| 12 | **first hour** | 1,185 | $158.5k | **2.20** | −$6.42k | 24.7 |
| 36 | first 3 h | 2,189 | $248.6k | 1.99 | −$10.2k | 24.5 |

- **The morning breakouts carry the edge** — PF rises monotonically the earlier you cut off (first-hour
  PF 2.20 vs all-day 1.61). On the unseen **lockbox, cutoff-12 PF = 3.48 vs 1.63**, and it has higher PF
  in **6/6 WF folds**. The quality signal is real and robust.
- **But it's quality-vs-quantity:** fewer trades → less total $ → *naive* MAR favors trading all day
  (32.8 > 24.7). So "just stop trading at 1pm" is NOT a drop-in win.
- **The payoff is edge-concentration, not truncation:** trade first-hour-only and **size up** (the higher
  PF supports more risk/trade), or tier size by time-of-day. Paired with §4.7 sizing this could match the
  all-day $ at lower drawdown, far fewer trades, less fee/slippage drag. → **backlog item G.**

### 4.10 Entry-time × sizing (item G) — the combo WINS ✅ *(best result of the study)*
Capital-matched to the **same total $risk budget** (a fair "where do you spend the risk?" test).
Tier weights (morning ×2 / midday ×1 / afternoon ×0.5) are a **fixed a-priori rule** → lockbox is clean OOS.

| scheme (capital-matched) | full MAR | lockbox MAR | full PF | lockbox PF |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| baseline all-day, size 1 | 38.6 | 6.88 | 1.61 | 1.63 |
| risk-parity alone (A) | 44.3 | 8.85 | 1.73 | 1.72 |
| time-tiered alone | 38.8 | 10.52 | 1.89 | 2.08 |
| morning-only truncation | 29.7 | 7.67 | 2.31 | 3.48 |
| **time-tiered × risk-parity (the combo)** | **48.1** | **12.74** | **2.02** | **2.16** |

- **The two edges stack.** Time-of-day tilt and risk-parity are independent; combined MAR (48.1 full,
  **12.74 lockbox = +85% vs baseline**) beats either alone. Combo MAR > baseline in **5/6 WF folds**,
  higher PF in all 6. Best risk-adjusted result in the whole ORB study.
- **Truncation is the wrong way to use the morning edge** — morning-only MAR (29.7) is *below* baseline:
  concentrating the whole risk budget into 31% of trades balloons drawdown. **Keep all trades, tilt size.**
- **Deploy = execution-layer overlay** (no entry/exit change): `size ∝ time_weight(entry_hour) ×
  cap3(1/stop_dist)`, then hard-cap the final size (§5.6). Raw combo maxSz ~14× → cap it for realism.
- Honest caveats: the tier weights are deliberately **un-tuned** (a-priori) to avoid overfit — surviving
  the lockbox un-tuned is the signal; a fitted weight curve would need its own WF. The `WR` on morning-only
  rows is a display artifact (zeroed afternoon trades dilute it) — read PF/MAR, not WR, there.

### 4.11 Long/short asymmetry (item D) — shorts carry the edge ✅ *(2nd-biggest finding)*
Split the deployable's trades by side (net of fees, size 1):

| side | trades | net $ | PF | MAR |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **LONG only** | 2,199 | $11.8k | **1.03** | 0.30 |
| **SHORT only** | 1,865 | $348.9k | **2.74** | 41.2 |

- **The longs are ~deadweight; the shorts are the whole edge.** Holds on the lockbox (SHORT PF 2.71 vs
  LONG 1.04) and **transfers to ES** (SHORT PF 2.18 vs LONG 1.09) → structural index-futures behaviour,
  not an NQ artifact. Plausible mechanism: indices gap up overnight, so the intraday *long* break of the
  tiny opening range buys the post-gap high and gets faded; *short* breaks catch the sharp risk-off moves.
- Stacks with everything (capital-matched):

| scheme | full MAR | lockbox MAR | lockbox PF |
|---|---|---|---|
| baseline | 38.6 | 6.88 | 1.63 |
| + short-tilt L0.5/S1.5 (alone) | 53.6 | 8.10 | 2.08 |
| G combo (time × rp) | 48.0 | 12.74 | 2.16 |
| **G combo + short-tilt (full deploy stack)** | **71.5** | **15.00** | 2.85 |
| full stack, short-**only** | 82.4 | 11.64 | **3.80** |

- **Short-*tilt* beats short-*only* on MAR** (a little long diversifies the drawdown) — same "tilt, don't cut"
  lesson as truncation. Full deploy stack: **lockbox MAR 15.0 = +118% vs baseline**, PF 2.85; 5/6 WF folds beat baseline.
- **The whole stack transfers to ES** (no re-fit, `python tools/orb_edge_report.py ES`): ES lockbox
  MAR **5.0 → 13.5 (+170%)**, PF 1.57 → 3.10, each lever adding monotonically (short-only ES lockbox PF 4.99).
  The short-tilt is the dominant lever on both instruments → the overlay is structural, not an NQ fit.
- **Caveats (deploy short-tilt, not hard short-only):** this is a 2010-2026 *secular-bull* sample; short
  books carry squeeze / gap-up tail risk; the short *direction* was chosen after seeing the split (though
  it's stark, OOS-confirmed, and cross-instrument). A regime flip could revive longs / punish shorts —
  size the tilt, keep some long, and re-check per regime.

### 4.12 Auto-Validate vs the deployable — the PF objective goes short-only (2026-07-09)
Reconciliation ask: compare 3.0 (137) vs 3.1 side-by-side, all auto-validated the same way. Two findings:

**(a) Auto-Validate on `ORB_3_1.py` does NOT reproduce 125 (run #150).** Same pipeline as 137 (NQ 5m RTH
no-adj, cost 0.533, discover=auto, 300 trials, 12mo lockbox). It PASSED but discovered a **short-only**
champion — `or1/stop1.75/trail6/target4.0R/partial1.5/atr0.6` — because Auto-Validate ranks by PF/robustness,
so it re-finds the §4.11 short edge and drops the near-break-even longs. *"Auto-validate the strategy" ≠
"validate 125"; to stamp the deployable you must PIN its params* — see `augur_strategies/ORB_3_1_125.py`
(deploy-lock: search space collapsed to the single 125 config → run #~151).

**(b) 4-way head-to-head** — each config's EXACT params on identical no-adj data (cost 0.533, full 2010–2026;
ALL 6/6 folds net-positive + lockbox-positive → *none overfit*), `tools/…/compare_configs.py`:

| config | net $ | max DD | PF | trades | **MAR** | LB PF |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| 136 · 3.0 grid argmax (or3/stop.75/ride, Both) | $561k | $26.5k | 1.40 | 4,060 | 21.1 | 1.29 |
| 137 · 3.0 auto-validate (or1/stop1.75/4.5R, Both) | **$567k** | $40.2k | 1.47 | 3,951 | 14.1 | 1.51 |
| **125 · 3.1 deployable** (or1/stop.75/trail5, Both) | $361k | **$9.4k** | 1.61 | 4,064 | **38.6** | 1.63 |
| 150 · 3.1 auto-validate (**short-only**) | $385k | $27.9k | 1.57 | 2,291 | 13.8 | **1.70** |

- **125 stays the risk-adjusted king** (MAR 38.6, DD $9.4k) — the trail's DD magic only appears in the
  Both / tight-stop / ride+trail form; the PF-maximizing search never reaches it.
- **137** = highest PnL + best "Both" lockbox, at 4× 125's drawdown. **136** is genuinely robust, just
  Pareto-dominated (137 on PF/lockbox, 125 on DD) → fine to keep archived. **150 short-only** has the best
  *recent* edge (LB PF 1.70) but 3× 125's DD — a research signal (§4.11), not the deployable.
- **Lever if you don't want short-only:** pin `trade_mode=Both`, or rank discovery by **MAR not PF**
  (why MAR-ranked 125 stays two-sided). Runs 126–133/135 archived (dups of 137 / dominated).

### 4.13 Anatomy of 137's −$40k drawdown + breakeven finding (2026-07-09)
137's max DD (−$40,233) is **Apr 9 → Jul 11 2025**: the tariff-shock crash + V-recovery (NQ 17,276 → low
17,202 → 22,955, +33%). 62 trades / 40 losers. **No session-time or direction filter dodges it — they
INVERT it:** open-hour trades lost −$21.6k (vs the usual morning edge), shorts lost −$21.9k (vs the usual
short edge). A macro shock flips ORB's average edges for a quarter. **Vol circuit-breaker (pause N sessions
after a >X% range day) = REJECTED** — skips too many trades (80 days >4%/yr), costs $30–80k PnL, and makes
the target window *worse* (skips recovery, not losers).

- **Breakeven-after-1.5R = a validated WIN on 137** (BE re-simulator reproduces the engine to $0.00/trade):
  move stop→entry once unrealized ≥ 1.5×risk. Full: **PnL $567k→$579k, max DD −$40.2k→−$30.8k (−24%),
  PF 1.47→1.51**. **Lockbox OOS holds: DD −$16.8k→−$14.2k (−15%), PnL flat, PF 1.53→1.57.** BE-1.0R cuts DD
  further (−$26.8k, PF 1.55) at slightly lower PnL. NOT overfit — improves IS *and* lockbox.
- **Mechanism correction (anti-overfit):** the swan losers did NOT run to huge MFE then give it back —
  median MFE of window losers **0.41R** ≈ all-history 0.39R; only 3/40 reached 2R. So an *extreme* 2R BE
  barely helps; the win is the **moderate 1–1.5R** BE catching the common "wide-stop pokes ~1R then fails"
  pattern across all 16y. It's a broad edge, not a swan patch. Next: add `be_after_R` to ORB_3_0/3_1 as a
  param + Auto-Validate it (candidate deployable — cheapest DD reduction found so far).
- **Time-of-day (full history):** edge is a *morning* phenomenon — 09:30–10:30 PF ~1.8 (+$307k of the total),
  12:00–13:00 lunch chop PF 1.11. Confirms §4.9. (In the Apr-2025 window this inverted.)
- **`close_confirm` (already coded in ORB_3_0.py) is HARMFUL on 137:** $567k→**$175k**, PF 1.47→1.14 —
  entering at the bar CLOSE (vs the range edge) worsens the fill on every real break (~$100/trade × 3,900 ≈
  the whole drop), dwarfing the false-wick savings. **Contradicts the reconcile "+$30k" claim → see §6 TODO.**

### 4.14 BE sweep, gap-free 0.9→2.5 · in-sample vs lockbox (2026-07-11) — run #156

Full `be_after_R` sweep in **0.1 steps, no gaps**, on the #137-lock (NQ 5m, or1/stop1.75/tgt4.5R/vol1.25/
atr0.1/Both). Each level is an **independent** backtest of the optimize window AND the held-out last-12mo
lockbox (own DD/PF), so the risk-adjusted read is honest. Anchor `be=0` reproduces #137 to the dollar
(opt $481,605 + lockbox $85,692 = **$567,297**).

| be_R | IS net | IS DD | IS MAR | LB net | LB DD | LB MAR | LB PF |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.0 (no BE) | $481,605 | $38,730 | 12.4 | $85,692 | $16,779 | 5.1 | 1.51 |
| 0.9 | $493,076 | $26,146 | 18.9 | $78,491 | $14,354 | 5.5 | 1.55 |
| **1.0 ★** | $493,105 | **$23,826** | **20.7** | $81,072 | **$11,491** | **7.1** | 1.54 |
| 1.1 | $493,875 | $25,486 | 19.4 | $79,577 | $12,070 | 6.6 | 1.53 |
| 1.2 | $503,664 | $25,486 | 19.8 | $86,647 | $12,974 | 6.7 | 1.57 |
| 1.3 | $500,149 | $25,486 | 19.6 | $86,352 | $13,914 | 6.2 | 1.56 |
| 1.4–1.5 | ~$495k | $29,308 | ~16.9 | ~$86k | $14,239 | 6.0 | 1.55 |
| 1.6–2.0 | ~$487k | $35–37k | ~13.5 | ~$85k | $14,239 | ~6.0 | ~1.53 |
| 2.1–2.6 | ~$482k | $37–39k | ~12.8 | ~$87k | $16,779 | **5.1** | 1.53 |

- **`be=1.0R` is the champion — best MAR in BOTH windows** (IS 20.7, LB 7.1); DD −38% IS ($38.7k→$23.8k),
  −32% LB ($16.8k→$11.5k) for a trivial PnL give-up. Robust plateau **0.9–1.3R**. Full-window: $574,177,
  DD −$26,763, PF 1.55, **MAR 21.5** (== run #154).
- **Why #153's raw pick (2.6R) is hollow:** BE only ever *costs* a sliver of PnL, so a PnL-max objective
  drifts to a high `be_after_R` that barely triggers ≈ plain #137 — by 2.1–2.6R the lockbox DD/MAR are back
  to the no-BE baseline ($16.8k / 5.1). It's not doing BE's job (cutting DD); the gate rightly flagged it WEAK.
  The right objective for a DD lever is **MAR, not PnL** (see §5.1, §5.5).
- Tooling: `tools/orb_be_sweep.py` (re-runnable). Saved as **run #156** ("BE sweep 0.9-2.5 · 137-locked").

### 4.15 BE-TRIGGER bake-off — does a smarter arm-signal beat 1.0R? (2026-07-12) — item K

Item H banked `be_after_R=1.0` (arm breakeven at 1.0×risk). **K asks whether a *different arming
signal* protects better.** `augur_strategies/ORB_3_0_BET.py` adds a `be_mode` selector (R / time-bars /
ATR / OR-width / structure) on the **frozen #137 base**; each trigger is swept **in isolation** (only the
trigger moves), on the optimize window AND the held-out lockbox, ranked by **MAR/DD — not PnL**. Anchors
reproduce #137 ($567,297) and BE-R=1.0 ($574,177 / DD −$26,763) **to the dollar**. Tool:
`tools/orb_be_triggers.py`.

Each family's **lockbox champion** vs the R=1.0 control:

| trigger | best thresh | LB MAR | LB DD | LB PF | LB net | IS MAR | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **R (control) ★** | 1.0×risk | **7.1** | **$11,491** | 1.54 | $81,072 | **20.7** | — |
| time (bars) | 2 bars | 4.0 | $14,576 | 1.60 | $58,611 | 18.7 | **loses** |
| ATR (×session) | 0.4 | 6.5 | $13,944 | 1.62 | $90,982 | 14.7 | richer, not safer |
| OR-width | 1.75×OR | 7.1 | $11,491 | 1.54 | $81,072 | 20.7 | **≡ R** (identical) |
| structure (1st HL/LH) | — | 3.2 | $18,162 | 1.47 | $58,971 | 16.6 | **loses** |

- **Verdict: nothing beats static `be_after_R=1.0` on risk-adjusted terms.** It has the best lockbox MAR
  (7.1) AND the lowest lockbox DD ($11.5k) AND the best in-sample MAR (20.7). **K confirms H — keep 1.0R.**
- **OR-width ≡ R (identical row) — not a new lever here.** Because risk = `stop_frac`×OR = 1.75×OR, arming
  at 1.0×risk *is* arming at 1.75×OR-width. OR-width only becomes distinct if `stop_frac` varies; with #137's
  stop pinned it's the same trigger in different units. (Useful check: both code paths agree to the dollar.)
- **ATR (0.4×session range) is the honest runner-up — but a different objective.** It arms *later* (larger
  distance), so it books more upside (LB net $90,982 / PF 1.62 vs $81,072 / 1.54) at a *worse* drawdown
  (LB $13.9k; IS DD $32.5k, IS MAR 14.7). A "let it breathe" variant that wins on PnL/PF, not DD — the
  opposite of what a breakeven is for. (If we ever optimize for PnL not DD, revisit ATR.)
- **Time and structure lose outright.** A pure time→BE arms regardless of price (wicks out / locks in
  underwater); the first-higher-low fires too eagerly. Every step trails the R control in both windows.
- **Takeaway:** the R-multiple is the right breakeven trigger and 1.0R stands. Item **K → DONE (verified —
  no dynamic/alternative trigger beats static 1.0R).**

### 4.16 Ensemble — 1-lot ride + 1-lot trail (2026-07-12) — item E ✅

Run the #137 entries as a **2-contract book**: Leg A rides to 4.5R/EOD with the validated 1.0R
breakeven (the deployable); Leg B keeps the same entry + 1.75 stop but **trails** the runner on an
N-bar low/high. Blend 50/50 per trade (`tools/orb_ensemble.py`) — the 1-contract-equivalent, so
MAR/DD compare on the same risk basis. in-sample + held-out lockbox.

| window | config | net | DD | MAR | PF | WR |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **LOCKBOX** | ride+BE (deploy) | $81,072 | $11,491 | 7.1 | 1.54 | 44% |
| **LOCKBOX** | trail-5 | $53,560 | $10,067 | 5.3 | 1.61 | 40% |
| **LOCKBOX** | **ENSEMBLE ride+trail-5** | $67,316 | **$7,321** | **9.2** | **1.61** | **48%** |
| FULL | ride+BE | $574,177 | $26,763 | 21.5 | 1.55 | 43% |
| FULL | trail-5 | $356,041 | $10,925 | 32.6 | 1.59 | 42% |
| FULL | ENSEMBLE ride+trail-5 | $465,109 | $17,439 | 26.7 | 1.61 | 50% |

- **WIN — the ensemble beats BOTH legs on lockbox MAR (9.2 vs ride 7.1 / trail 5.3) AND has the
  lowest lockbox DD ($7,321 vs $11,491 / $10,067).** Genuine diversification, not just smoothing: the
  ride's and trail's drawdowns don't coincide, so blending cuts tail risk *below either leg* and lifts
  risk-adjusted return *above both*. Lockbox **MAR +30%** over the ride-only deploy, **DD −36%**.
- **Robustness is the story.** Full-window, trail-*only* has the highest MAR (32.6) — but out-of-sample
  its MAR (5.3) sinks BELOW the ride; the ensemble is the only config whose lockbox MAR beats the ride.
  Best PF in every window (1.61) and the highest win rate (48–51% — the trail leg books more greens).
- **trail-5 is the best runner** (trail-3/8 within noise); ride+trail-5 ≈ ride+trail-8.
- **Caveat:** 2 contracts = **2× fees + 2× margin**; the blend is the 1-contract-equivalent (average).
  Worth it only if you trade ≥2 lots. WF-folds + ES transfer of the ensemble are still TODO before deploy.
- Tooling: `tools/orb_ensemble.py`. Item **E → DONE (WIN — ensemble beats both legs on lockbox MAR + DD).**
- **Full Auto-Validate (2026-07-12): run #159 — PASS 6/6, 8/8 WF folds held, lockbox PF 1.61.** The
  ensemble as one strategy (`ORB_3_0_ENS.py`, 50/50-blend accounting; anchor == the harness to the
  dollar). Base pinned to #137; runner knobs open — discovery picked **target 4.0R / trail 12** (net
  $181,431 / DD $10,611 / PF 1.57 in-window); §4.16's 4.5R/trail-5 sits on the same plateau (trail 3–12
  all close). The most complete report card in the family: better PF and DD than the single-lot master.
- **Master single-lot report re-run the same day: run #157** (`ORB_3_0_BEAV.py` — #137 base space OPEN,
  `trade_mode` pinned Both after the first pass wandered Short Only per §4.12, BE 1.0R baked into every
  config). **PASS 6/6, 8/8 folds, lockbox PF 1.49**, 200-config space on the tiles. NOTE: with BE baked
  in, discovery's champion is **or3 / stop 1.25 / tgt 3.5R / atr 0.2** (net $174,480 / DD $14,001) — a
  *milder* base than #137's or1/stop1.75/tgt4.5. The #137+BE exact config remains the reference deploy
  (#154/#156 validated); #157's space shows the BE-on surface around it.

### 4.17 Black-swan / regime filters — daily-trend structure + VIX (2026-07-12) — item M

Owner idea: "biggest DD was COVID — filter black swans (daily lower-lows, VIX)". **Premise check
came back the other way:** on the deploy config (BE 1.0R) the worst underwater episodes are
**post-spike CHOP, not crashes** — #1 2025-04-09→07-11 (−$27.4k, tariff-chop; the window still *nets*
+$26.6k), #2 Sep–Dec 2021 (−$18.0k), #3 Feb–Jul 2023 low-vol grind (−$18.0k); **COVID is only #4**
(−$16.2k) and Feb-15→Apr-30 2020 *nets +$4.1k*. ORB feeds on vol expansion (2022 = best year).

Tested both filter families anyway (`tools/orb_regime_filters.py` — trade-list overlay, causal
prior-day signals, ^VIX daily via yfinance). Deploy config, full window + lockbox:

| filter (skip when…) | full net | full DD | full MAR | LB MAR | short PnL removed |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **none (baseline) ★** | **$574,177** | $26,763 | **21.5** | **7.1** | — |
| prior day lower-low | $321,277 | **$15,677** | 20.5 | 5.0 | −$161,165 |
| 2 consecutive lower-lows | $432,476 | $20,943 | 20.6 | 6.0 | −$84,196 |
| lower-high AND lower-low | $372,131 | $22,201 | 16.8 | 2.6 | −$118,595 |
| close < SMA20 / SMA50 | $277k / $262k | ~$26k / $23k | 10.5 / 11.4 | 2.9 / 5.6 | −$187k / −$177k |
| VIX > 20 / 25 | $353k / $432k | $21k / $27k | 16.8 / 16.2 | 5.0 / 5.6 | −$139k / −$60k |
| VIX > 30 (least bad) | $520,598 | $25,699 | 20.3 | 6.7 | **+$11,760 (losers)** |
| VIX > 40 | $523,309 | $30,951 | 16.9 | 7.1 | −$980 |

- **Verdict: NO filter improves MAR in either window — keep the base unfiltered.** Down-regime
  filters amputate the SHORT side, which carries ORB's edge (§4.11, short PF 2.74): the lower-low
  skip cuts DD to $15.7k but burns $253k of net ($161k of it short wins) → MAR *falls*.
- VIX>30 is the only near-wash (the trades it removes include net-losing shorts) — still no MAR gain.
- **What actually addresses the DD:** the levers already banked — breakeven 1.0R (−33% DD), the
  ensemble (#159, lockbox DD −36% vs ride), and the §5.6 risk-parity sizing (wide ranges → smaller
  size, which *automatically* de-risks crisis vol without cutting the short edge).

### 4.18 Entry-confirmation bake-off — close-confirm rejected in every flavor (2026-07-12) — item J

The contradiction: reconcile said TV's close-based model (skip false wicks) netted **+$30k more**
over 15y, but `close_confirm=True` on #137 was **−$392k**. Was the wick-skip good and only the
close-price *fill* bad? `ORB_3_0_CC.py` separates confirmation from fill (`entry_mode`) on the
frozen #137+BE base; `tools/orb_close_confirm.py` runs all modes, IS + lockbox. Anchors reproduce
#137, #154 and the −$392k trap ($174,677) **to the dollar**.

| entry mode (be=1.0) | IS net | IS MAR | LB net | LB MAR | LB n | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **touch the level (deploy) ★** | **$493,105** | **20.7** | $81,072 | **7.1** | 242 | keep |
| close-confirm, fill at close | $137,731 | 4.2 | $29,266 | 1.3 | 238 | ✗✗ |
| close-confirm, fill next open | $131,317 | 4.0 | $29,549 | 1.3 | 219 | ✗✗ |
| close-confirm, limit at level | $5,976 | 0.2 | $16,646 | 1.6 | 86 | ✗✗✗ |

- **Verdict: the touch entry IS the strategy — item J → DONE (close-confirm rejected).** Every
  confirmation flavor loses ~72–99% of the net, in both windows, long before fees.
- **The decomposition kills the "it's just the fill" theory:** fill-at-close ≈ fill-at-next-open
  (both ~$131–138k IS) — so the damage is the **confirmation delay itself**. On a 1-bar OR the real
  breaks are momentum bars; waiting for the 5m close means chasing the move by most of a bar, which
  wrecks the R-geometry on every winner. The 306 skipped false wicks (−$149k) are *cheap* next to that.
- **The TV-style "limit back at the level" is the worst of all:** only 46% of sessions ever retrace
  to fill (1,715 vs 3,709 IS) — the runaway breaks that never look back ARE the ORB edge, and this
  entry structurally misses exactly those. IS net ≈ $6k. Case closed.
- **Resolving the reconcile number:** TV's +$30k was a *fill-model artifact* on a different config
  comparison, not harvestable alpha — implemented any realistic way on the deploy config, the
  close-based entry destroys the edge. The engine's touch-fill stays; false wicks are the cost of
  catching runaways.

### 4.19 Owner-brainstorm round 1 — N · O · Q · S · T · W tested (2026-07-12)

Six of the ten proposed levers, each with anchors + in-sample AND lockbox. **None earns a deploy
change; two produced bankable knowledge.** Deploy config throughout (BE 1.0R).

**N — DD-throttle sizing (half size while the book is >$X underwater) — ✗ fails the lockbox gate.**
Full-window MAR jumps (21.5 → **26.2** at X=$15k/f=0.5; the throttle tames the long grind episodes)
but lockbox MAR drops in EVERY variant (best 6.5 vs 7.1) — a throttle structurally re-risks late in a
V-recovery, so it bleeds the rebound year. f=0 (full stop while underwater) is a catastrophe (92%
halted, net ≈ $2k) — confirms the M lesson from the equity side. Tool: `tools/orb_meta_sizing.py`.

**O — equity-curve gate (size down when equity < its rolling k-trade mean) — ✗ same shape.**
Best full MAR 25.7 (k=20, f=0.5) but lockbox 5.2 vs 7.1. Same structural flaw as N.

**Q — re-entry / stop-and-reverse (2nd trade after a stop-out) — ✗ all three modes lose.**
`ORB_3_0_RE.py` (rebreak / flip / sar; anchor `none` == #154 to the dollar). IS MAR craters 20.7 →
12–14 on all modes (extra trades add DD ~50% faster than net); `flip` adds +18% lockbox net
($95.5k vs $81.1k) but still loses MAR in both windows; `sar` is clearly bad (LB MAR 3.7).
Whipsaw days don't pay for a second shot. Tool: `tools/orb_reentry.py`.

**S/T — context diagnostics (ON-range confluence · gap-vs-side) — ◐ no lever, good map.**
`tools/orb_context_buckets.py`. **No toxic bucket exists** (every context is net-positive → nothing to
filter — M holds). But expectancy is very lopsided, and both signals point the same way:
| golden bucket | n | avg$/trade | PF |
|---|---|---|---|
| SHORT on a big **gap-up** day (against-gap) | 579 | **$319** | **2.47** |
| SHORT inside the ON range | 1,060 | $271 | 2.24 |
| LONG beyond the ON high (chasing) | 1,165 | $50 | 1.18 |
| LONG with a big gap-up | 676 | $53 | 1.20 |
This is the §4.11 short-edge seen through a finer lens: **responsive shorts against overnight
strength are the cream; longs chasing overnight highs are marginal (but still positive).** Optional
future refinement: a 4th tilt dimension for the §5.6 sizing overlay (gap/ON context) — deferred to
avoid over-conditioning the overlay (already 3 factors).

**W — portfolio blend ORB × ENGU-Q — ◐ mechanism confirmed, partner not ready.**
`tools/orb_portfolio.py`. Daily-PnL correlation ORB(NQ 5m) × ENGU-Q(ES 1m, validated defaults):
**−0.03 over 4,001 trading days** — genuinely uncorrelated, exactly what a portfolio wants. BUT the
ENGU-Q defaults collapse over the full 16y (PF 1.08, MAR 1.6, DD $73k — its validation window was
far shorter), so every blend dilutes ORB (blend MAR 9.1–16.8 vs ORB alone 21.5). **Bank the
correlation; revisit W when ENGU-Q has a full-window-validated config.** (Also: #158's Auto-Validate
verdict was FAIL 4/6 — the ENGU-Q free-search config is not blendable either.)

**Still open from the brainstorm:** P (chop detector), R (failed-break fade), U (pyramid at +1R),
V (order-flow delta — forward-test only, months of data).

---

### 4.20 Owner-brainstorm round 2 — U · R · P tested; the sweep is complete (2026-07-12)

**U — pyramid at +1R (add lot B when the trade proves itself) — ✗ crushed by the at-entry ensemble.**
`ORB_3_0_PYR.py` (lot B = resting stop at entry ± pyramid_at_R × risk, stop at lot-A entry, N-bar
trail; 2-contract-capital blend accounting identical to the ensemble). Every variant loses BOTH
windows by a wide margin: best pyramid IS MAR 18.4 / LB 5.6 vs ensemble **27.0 / 9.2**. Adding at +R
is buying the extension — lot B enters a full R worse than lot A and trails out on every pullback,
while lot A's entry risk was already neutralized by the breakeven. **The at-entry ensemble stays.**
Tool: `tools/orb_pyramid.py`.

**R — failed-break fade — ✗ no standalone edge exists.**
`ORB_FADE_1_0.py` (first pierce of an OR edge that closes back inside → trade AGAINST it; stop
beyond the wick +0.15×rng; target far edge / R-multiples; vol-gated variant fades only the pokes the
deploy ORB actually entered). **Every config is NET NEGATIVE in both windows** (PF 0.74–0.93,
IS −$33k to −$63k). The −$149k the wicks cost ORB is NOT sitting there in reverse: a failed break
leads to **chop, not reversal** — both directions lose on those days once fees are paid. Useful
negative: don't try to monetize the trap from either side.

**P — chop detector on the OR — ◐ hypothesis inverted; nothing new to build.**
Diagnostics on the deploy trades (causal at entry): **wide-OR days are the BEST bucket** (OR >30% of
the trailing 20-day range: PF 1.80, $259/trade, 53% WR) — not the chop hazard; no OR-width bucket is
toxic. Break-delay buckets restate item C/G: mid-morning breaks (7–15 bars) are the cream (PF 2.33,
$330), late breaks (16+ bars, 63% of trades) are the thin-edge bulk (PF 1.30, $82) — still positive,
already handled by the §5.6 time-tilt. **Chop is not identifiable before entry; the sizing overlay
already prices the identifiable part.**

**Brainstorm scoreboard (10/10 addressed):** N ✗ · O ✗ · P ◐ · Q ✗ · R ✗ · S ◐ · T ◐ · U ✗ · V ⏳
forward-test (needs delta history) · W ◐ (blocked on a full-window ENGU-Q). **Zero deploy changes out
of ten ideas — the book (touch entry · BE 1.0R · at-entry ensemble · §5.6 sizing) survived every
challenger. Banked upside: the gap/ON-context tilt map (§4.19) and the −0.03 ORB×ENGU-Q correlation.**

### 4.21 ORB 3.1 at 1-minute granularity (challenger round 2, 2026-07-13) — ✗ CLOSED by item X (slippage-fragile)

Ran the champion through the engine on the **NQ 1m RTH master** (pre-lockbox, cost 0.533): 68 configs —
or_bars {1,2,3,5} × stop {0.75,1.0,1.5} × vol {0,1.25} × trail {10,20,30} + the 5m-analog row.
- Best: **or_bars=1 (a 1-MINUTE opening range — impossible on 5m), stop 0.75, vol 1.25, trail 10** →
  n=3,865, $257k, PF 1.87, DD −$8.4k, **MAR 30.8** vs the 5m champion's 32.8 on the same window.
- BUT every competitive 1m config carries an avg loss of 5.4–6.2 pts — under the ~8-pt floor where the
  exact-stop-fill + 0.25-pt slippage assumption stays honest (the §8 tight-stop artifact). The numbers
  are optimistic as shown; do NOT deploy off them.
- The 1m "analog" of the 5m champion (or=5, trail=25) scored only MAR 11.8 — a discrete 5-bar-5m trail
  is NOT equivalent to a rolling 25-bar-1m trail; granularity changes the trail's character entirely.
- **Open test → backlog item X (slippage stress-test):** rerun the 1m grid at 0.5 / 0.75 / 1.0-pt
  slippage. If the or=1 family still clears MAR ~25+ at 0.75 pt, the 1-minute opening range becomes a
  real deploy candidate; if it collapses, close the item. Reproduction: session scratchpad
  round2_triage_report.md / shotA_orb1m.py (challenger program, BACKTESTING_STACK.md §3).
- **Item X RESULT (2026-07-13, run same session):** stress-tested at 0.25/0.5/0.75/1.0-pt slippage
  (18 configs re-costed from gross trades, shortcut verified against a direct engine run to the dollar).
  At the 0.75-pt test point the or=1 family's best = **MAR 24.3** (family median 21.2) — below the
  pre-registered ≥25 bar — while the 5m champion holds **MAR 28.3 under identical stress** (still ≥25
  out to 1.0-pt). The 1m family is genuinely more slippage-fragile (its 5–6-pt avg losses are the
  mechanism), not a symmetric-cost effect; or=2 is uniformly worse than or=1 at every level.
  **✗ CLOSED — the 5m champion stands; 1m ORB is not a deploy candidate.** Repro: session scratchpad
  itemX_slippage_report.md / itemX_slippage.py.

### 4.22 Overnight holdover (challenger round 3, 2026-07-13) — ✗ flat-EOD is CONFIRMED optimal

Grafted overnight holds onto the champion on the **ETH master** (stop live on every Globex bar,
gap-honest fills, roll-Wednesday force-flat): hold_R {always, 0, 0.5, 1, 2} × {exit next open, ride
with trail, 3/10-day caps} = 15 variants + the flat-EOD baseline.
- **Every variant loses MAR.** Best (hold only ≥2R winners, ride, 3-day cap): 32.02 / $299.5k vs the
  flat-EOD baseline's 32.78 / $306.5k — and it degrades monotonically to MAR 8.0 for
  hold-always/next-open. Overnight adds gap + roll risk without adding edge on these entries.
- Corollary banked for ANY future overnight variant: the NOADJ contract-roll seam (~77 pts/quarter)
  lands a few days BEFORE roll-Wednesday (the stitcher rolls on volume dominance, not the calendar) —
  a Wednesday flatten is only a backstop; an overnight strategy must detect the seam itself.
- **CLOSED — do not revisit without new data.** Full record: BACKTESTING_STACK.md §3 (challenger
  rounds 2–3), session scratchpad round3_triage_report.md / shotE_holdover.py.

## 5. What a pro would actually do here (principles)

1. **Size on drawdown, not PnL.** Fixed max-DD risk budget → at −$9k DD you carry ~2.8× the
   contracts you could at −$26k. 2.8 × $307k ≈ **$860k** vs the single-lot's $407k. The
   "lower-PnL" trailed config is really the ~2× *higher*-earning one at equal risk.
   **Headline PnL is a trap; MAR/Calmar is the currency.**
2. **Decompose levers; keep only what pays.** We split trail vs partial; trail carries the water.
   Drop the partial from deploy (no MAR gain, more complexity). Occam.
3. **Demand a plateau, not a spike.** t3/t5/t8 all score MAR 27-33 → robust, not curve-fit.
4. **Trust the lockbox over the in-sample number.** The chandelier's prettier in-sample MAR was
   a mirage; the reserved slice is the only honest judge.
5. **Rank deploy decisions by MAR in the app.** The runs table already stores `best_dd_usd`; a
   MAR column / `rank_by="mar"` is a trivial, high-value add (would've surfaced this on sweep #1).
6. **Size each signal by its stop, its entry hour, AND its side (§4.7 + §4.10 + §4.11 deploy rule).**
   `contracts = round( T · S · RISK_$ / (0.75 × OR_width_pts × $per_pt) )`, clamped to `[1, 3× baseline]`,
   where **RISK_$** = fixed per-trade dollar risk (~0.5-1% equity), **T** = time-of-day tilt (≈2× first-hour,
   1× midday, 0.5× afternoon), **S** = side tilt (≈1.5× short, 0.5× long — shorts carry the edge). Tight-stop
   / morning / short signals get more contracts. Three **independent** edges that stack → **lockbox MAR 6.9 → 15.0**.
   Execution-layer only; entries/exits unchanged. Implemented in `augur_engine/sizing.py`; reproduce with
   `python tools/orb_edge_report.py`. **The 3× cap isn't just realism — it *improves* MAR:** uncapped, the
   rule occasionally sizes ~22× base (bloating drawdown); capping at 3× lifts full-history MAR **71.5 → 96.1**
   ($921k → $590k net, biggest position 3× base). The web report card's overlay uses the 3× cap.

## 6. Backlog — investigation TODO

**Letters are a stable index, not a running order.** Each idea got the next free letter when it
was first raised (A–H early; J/K/L later; "I" skipped to avoid 1/I confusion). They do NOT imply
sequence, and nothing "starts at E": **A B C D F G H L are all DONE** — only **E, J, K** remain open.

**Open priority (owner 2026-07-12; K closed 2026-07-12):**
1. ~~**K — verify the breakeven trigger.**~~ ✅ **DONE (§4.15)** — swept time / ATR / OR-width / structure vs
   the R control; **nothing beats static `be_after_R=1.0`** on lockbox MAR+DD. 1.0R stands.
2. ~~**E — the 1-lot-ride + 1-lot-trail ensemble.**~~ ✅ **DONE (§4.16)** — **WIN**: ensemble beats both legs
   on lockbox MAR (9.2 vs 7.1 / 5.3) with the lowest DD ($7.3k). Diversification, not just smoothing.
3. ~~**J — close-confirm / candle-confirm reconciliation.**~~ ✅ **DONE (§4.18)** — close-confirm rejected in
   EVERY fill flavor (at-close / next-open / limit-at-level all lose 72–99% of net in both windows); the
   damage is the confirmation *delay*, not the fill; TV's +$30k = fill-model artifact. **Touch entry stays.**
4. **Deploy — the live-web sizing toggle** (pure wiring; the ONLY open item — do when ready to take the stack live).
5. ~~**M — black-swan / regime filters (daily lower-lows, VIX).**~~ ✅ **DONE (§4.17)** — premise inverted
   (COVID nets +$4.1k; worst DD = 2025 post-spike chop) and **no filter improves MAR in either window**
   (they amputate the short edge). Keep the base unfiltered; DD is handled by BE + ensemble + rp-sizing.

**Proposed (owner brainstorm 2026-07-12) — lesson from B/M applied: levers that KEEP trading but change
size or ADD trades, not filters that delete sessions:**
- ☑ **N — DD-throttle sizing** — ✗ NO (§4.19): full MAR +22% but lockbox MAR falls in every variant.
- ☑ **O — equity-curve gate** — ✗ NO (§4.19): same shape as N; throttles re-risk late in V-recoveries.
- ☑ **P — chop detector on the OR** — ◐ inverted (§4.20): wide-OR days are the BEST bucket; delay ≈ item G.
- ☑ **Q — re-entry / stop-and-reverse** — ✗ NO (§4.19): all modes lose MAR both windows; flip = +18% LB net but +DD.
- ☑ **R — failed-break fade** — ✗ NO EDGE (§4.20): every config net-negative both windows; failed breaks → chop, not reversal.
- ☑ **S — overnight-range confluence** — ◐ diagnostic (§4.19): no toxic bucket; responsive shorts = cream.
- ☑ **T — gap conditioning** — ◐ diagnostic (§4.19): shorts on gap-up days PF 2.47; longs-with-gap marginal.
- ☑ **U — pyramid at +1R** — ✗ NO (§4.20): buying the extension; ensemble beats it by 2× MAR in both windows.
- ☐ **V — order-flow delta confirmation:** NT 10s delta on the breakout bar (months of data → forward-test).
- ☑ **W — portfolio blend ORB × ENGU-Q** — ◐ (§4.19): correlation −0.03 (gold) but ENGU-Q defaults fail 16y (PF 1.08); revisit with a full-window ENGU-Q config.
- ☑ **X — 1m slippage stress-test** — ✗ **CLOSED (§4.21):** or=1 family best MAR 24.3 at 0.75-pt slip
  (< the pre-registered 25 bar) vs the 5m champion's 28.3 under identical stress — the 1m opening range
  is slippage-fragile, not a deploy candidate. No open new-params leads remain for ORB.

| # | idea | expected payoff | status | result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **M** | **Black-swan / regime filters** — skip sessions after daily lower-lows / below SMA, or when VIX is elevated (owner idea 2026-07-12: "don't trade black swans") | MED (DD reduction hope) | ☑ DONE (§4.17) | **NO — every variant lowers MAR in BOTH windows.** Premise inverted: COVID Feb–Apr 2020 *nets +$4.1k* (only the #4 DD episode); the worst DDs are post-spike **chop** (2025 tariff-chop −$27.4k, 2021 top −$18k, 2023 grind −$18k). Down-regime skips cut the SHORT side that carries the edge (lower-low skip: DD $26.8k→$15.7k but −$253k net → MAR falls). VIX>30 = least bad (removes net-losing shorts), still no gain. Tool: `tools/orb_regime_filters.py`. Crisis de-risking comes free from §5.6 risk-parity sizing (wide range → small size). |
| **J** | **Candle-confirmation / close-confirm reconciliation** — `close_confirm` (enter on bar CLOSE beyond the range, skipping false-wick breaks) is ALREADY coded in `ORB_3_0.py`. `tools/reconcile.py` says TV's close-based model skipped 306 false wicks (−$149,562) and netted **+$30k** more than the engine over 15y. BUT tested on **137's config** `close_confirm=True` is **−$392k** ($567k→$175k, PF 1.47→1.14) because entering at the close worsens the fill on every real break. | **HIGH** (reconciles engine↔TV; possible new version) | ☑ DONE (§4.18) | **RESOLVED — close-confirm rejected in every flavor.** `ORB_3_0_CC.py` (entry_mode: touch / close / close-next-open / close-limit-at-level) + `tools/orb_close_confirm.py`; anchors reproduce #137/#154/the −$392k trap to the dollar. Fill-at-close ≈ fill-at-next-open (~$131–138k IS vs touch $493k) → the damage is the confirmation DELAY (chasing a momentum bar wrecks R-geometry), not the fill price. The TV-style limit-back-at-the-level is worst (only 46% of sessions retrace → misses the runaways = the edge; IS net ≈ $6k). TV's +$30k = fill-model artifact. **Touch entry stays deploy.** |
| **H** | **Breakeven-after-R** (`be_after_R` param) — move stop→entry once unrealized ≥ X·risk | **HIGH** | ☑ DONE → **run #154 PASS** | **Fine sweep (0.1 steps, 0–4R; §4.13):** NOT monotonic — **0.1–0.5R is a trap** (lockbox PF collapses to 1.27–1.34); **0.9–1.3R = robust plateau** (full DD ~−30%, LB PF 1.55–1.59, MAR 20–21.5 vs 14.1); ≥1.6R fades to baseline. **Run #153** (free search): picked noise 2.6R → **WEAK/PBO-fail** — the IS PnL objective can't see a DD lever; gates caught it. **Run #154** (pinned **1.0R**, 137-lock): **PASS 5/5 applicable gates**, whole-run **DD −$40,233→−$26,763 (−33%)**, net $574k, PF 1.55, MAR 14.1→21.5, MC-P95 DD improved −$39.7k→−$36.9k; same 3,951 trades. File: `ORB_3_0_BE.py`. Caveat: the 1.0R level was picked on a sweep that saw the lockbox (defense: wide flat plateau). **BE-1.0R is the new best single-lot ORB 3.0 deploy candidate.** Gap-free 0.9→2.5 sweep with an independent lockbox split (**run #156**, §4.14) re-confirms 1.0R as the MAR champion in BOTH windows (IS 20.7, LB 7.1). |
| **K** | **Dynamic / alternative breakeven triggers** — the R-multiple trigger (item H) is one of many possible "arm BE now" signals. Candidates: **time-based** (BE after N bars in trade), **ATR-based** (unrealized ≥ X × session ATR), **OR-width multiple** (price has traveled ≥ X × range width — decouples from stop_frac), **structure** (first higher-low / lower-high after entry), **vol-scaled R** (tighter arm on high-vol days). Owner idea 2026-07-10. | MED-HIGH (item H already banked −33% DD; this asks if a smarter trigger beats static 1.0R) | ☑ DONE (§4.15) | **VERIFIED — no trigger beats static 1.0R.** Built `ORB_3_0_BET.py` (`be_mode` selector) + `tools/orb_be_triggers.py`; swept time / ATR / OR-width / structure in isolation, in-sample + lockbox, ranked by MAR/DD. Best-in-lockbox vs the R=1.0 control: **R 7.1 MAR / $11.5k DD** (champ); time 4.0 / $14.6k; ATR-0.4 6.5 / $13.9k (richer PnL+PF, worse DD); OR-width **≡ R** (1.75×OR = 1.0×risk with stop 1.75); structure 3.2 / $18.2k. Anchors reproduce #137 + BE-R=1.0 to the dollar. **Keep `be_after_R=1.0`.** |
| **L** | **Param-vs-RISK charts in the run report** — the 2C/2E/2J/2K charts plot each config's **PnL** only, so a drawdown lever like `be_after_R` looks FLAT and its real effect (DD −33%) is invisible; #153's PDP "peak" at 2.6R was a ±2% PnL ripple. Fix: carry `dd`/`mar` per config in the saved `points` rows (engine `history.py`/`optimize.py`) + a metric toggle (PnL / MAX DD / MAR) on the 2C·2E·2J·2K charts. | **HIGH** (web+engine feature — makes risk levers visible & rankable in the report) | ☑ DONE (v50.8 web + engine; demo run #155) | **SHIPPED 2026-07-10.** Engine: every grid/auto/validate run stores per-config `dd` (drawdown magnitude) in the saved points. Web: CHART METRIC toggle (NET $ / MAX DD / MAR ×100) above 2B re-plots 2B·2C·2H·2I·2J. Proof = run **#155** (BE sweep, 137-locked): PnL view is flat (±2%) but MAX DD view shows the 0.9–1.3R valley ($26.8k vs $40.2k at be=0). Older runs show a "re-run to record it" note. NB: the v49.5 per-column VALUE-filter menus were a separate feature and were REVERTED (v50.9) after they could hide the whole runs list — do not confuse the two. |
| **E** | **Ensemble** — 1 lot full-ride + 1 lot trailed → blended 2-contract book (your original idea, done right) | MED (expected: smoothing) | ☑ DONE (§4.16) | **WIN — better than expected.** Blend of the ride+BE deploy and a trail-5 runner (same entries) **beats BOTH legs on lockbox MAR** (9.2 vs ride 7.1 / trail 5.3) with the **lowest lockbox DD** ($7,321 vs $11.5k / $10.1k) — genuine diversification (drawdowns don't coincide), not just smoothing. LB MAR +30% / DD −36% vs ride-only; best PF (1.61) + WR (48%) in every window. Caveat: 2 lots = 2× fees/margin; WF + ES transfer still TODO. `tools/orb_ensemble.py`. |
| — | Smarter trailing (chandelier / activate / breakeven) | — | ☑ DONE | chandelier overfits; activate hurts; breakeven wash. **Simple bar-trail wins.** |
| A | **Vol-target (risk-parity) sizing** | HIGH | ☑ DONE | **WIN (modest, generalizes)** — lockbox MAR +29% (6.9→8.9), DD ~halved, PF→1.73, survives lockbox + 4/6 WF folds. Best = `rp-cap3` overlay (§4.7, deploy rule §5.6). |
| B | **Regime skip** (`atr_filter`) | MED-HIGH | ☑ DONE | **NO help** (§4.8) — every filter>0 lowers MAR/PF/PnL, DD doesn't improve. The trail already neutralizes low-vol days (substitutes, not complements). Leave off. |
| C | **Time structure** (`ORB_3_3.py`) | MED | ☑ DONE | time-stop ✗ (cuts winners); **entry-time cutoff = real quality signal** (first-hour PF 2.2, lockbox 3.5, 6/6 WF folds) but quality-vs-quantity on raw MAR → spawned item **G** (§4.9). |
| **G** | **Entry-time × sizing combo** | HIGH | ☑ DONE | **WIN** (§4.10). Time-tilt × risk-parity *stack*: lockbox MAR +85% (6.9→12.7), 5/6 WF folds. Truncation ✗ — tilt, don't cut. |
| **D** | **Long/short asymmetry** | MED | ☑ DONE | **WIN — shorts carry the edge** (§4.11). LONG PF 1.03 (deadweight) vs SHORT PF 2.74; holds on lockbox + ES. Short-tilt stacks → full stack lockbox MAR **15.0 (+118%)**, PF 2.85. Deploy short-tilt not short-only. |
| **F** | **Consolidate — durable code + sizing/MAR in the app** | HIGH leverage | ☑ DONE | `augur_engine/sizing.py` (rp × time × side overlay); `tools/orb_edge_report.py` + `tools/orb_sized_backtest.py`; `run_grid(rank_by="mar")`; `history.py` `mar` field. **Live in the web app:** MAR column (v44.5) + the **SIZING OVERLAY card on ORB run reports** with an **interactive "▶ Compute exact overlay for this run" button (v44.8)** — queues a sized backtest, renders baseline-vs-sized MAR/PF on the report card. `engine.run_backtest(sizing=…)` + runner `sizing` passthrough are the plumbing. **ORB sizing feature fully on the site.** |
| — | ES transfer (base config + long/short + full sizing stack) | — | ☑ DONE | **PASS all three** — base ES lockbox PF 1.57; long/short asymmetry transfers; **full sizing stack transfers** (ES lockbox MAR 5.0→13.5 = +170%, PF→3.10). |
| — | Walk-forward + lockbox of the scale-out | — | ☑ DONE | **PASS** (6/6 folds, lockbox PF 1.63) |

**Recommended next (revised 2026-07-12):** edge-hunting is done. The remaining research is a
_verification_ question, not a hunt — item **K** asks whether the static 1.0R breakeven (item H)
is actually the best arm-trigger, or whether a time / ATR / OR-width / structure / vol-scaled trigger
beats it. Do K first (fast, in the `ORB_3_0_BE` re-simulator), then **E** (the ride+trailed ensemble),
then **J** (close-confirm reconciliation). Everything else is shipped or built.

**Deploy — the live-web sizing toggle (do last):** the 3-lever sizing overlay (risk-parity × time-tilt
× short-tilt — items A/G/D stacked) is already a **first-class engine call** (`run_backtest(sizing=…)`,
runnable via `tools/orb_sized_backtest.py`), the **MAR column is live (v44.5)**, and ORB run reports carry
an on-demand **"▶ Compute exact overlay for this run" button (v44.8)**. What's NOT done is making the sized
version a _standing_ mode: add a runner `sized_backtest` job type + a UI toggle so the site runs the sized
stack as a first-class strategy instead of an after-the-fact overlay. It edits `index.html` + the runner,
so it's the deliberate "take it live" action — owner does it when ready. Or just **deploy the §5.6 rule**
at the execution layer without any web change.

## 7. Methodology & reproduction notes

- **Engine, headless (no Streamlit):** `augur_engine.optimize.run_grid` (constrained grid sweep,
  `grid={param:[...]}`, `date_from/date_to` windowing, `cost_pts`, `rank_by`), and
  `augur_engine.engine.run_backtest` (single config). Both match the app's math (`_apply_costs`).
- **Data:** `find_master("NQ","5m","rth")` → `NOADJ_NQ_5m_RTH.csv`. ES via `"ES"`.
- **Scale-out accounting (3.1/3.2):** a scaled-out session books **one blended trade** = `partial*0.5
  + runner*0.5`, so `num_trades`/`win_rate` stay comparable to single-lot runs and v2 history.
- **Invariant guarantee (3.2):** with `trail_atr=0, trail_activate_R=0, breakeven_R=0` the file is
  byte-equivalent to 3.1 — asserted in the `__main__` smoke test (`python augur_strategies/ORB_3_2.py`).
- **Walk-forward:** expanding window, 6 folds over the pre-lockbox span; per fold optimize the grid on
  all prior data, test the champion OOS; then one lockbox look for the full-span champion.
- **Durable artifacts (item F):** `augur_engine/sizing.py` = the sizing overlays (risk-parity × time-tilt ×
  side-tilt, capital-matched) + `trade_features()` (recompute per-trade risk/entry-bar/side from engine
  trades) + `mar()`. `tools/orb_edge_report.py [NQ|ES]` reproduces the §4 edge-stack tables exactly.
  `run_grid(rank_by="mar")` ranks by drawdown-adjusted return (verified; commit pending shared-file coord).
- *(The exploratory WF/rerank scripts ran from the session scratchpad and are ephemeral — this doc, the
  engine calls above, and the `tools/` report are the durable record.)*

---

## 8. Lessons / caveats (rap sheet)

- **0.5 stop floor is real** — sub-0.5 stops inflate PF via the exact-stop-fill assumption
  (stop 0.1 → fake PF 4.5). Run 121's 0.25 stop is why its numbers looked too good.
- **Gap-through realism is on** — stop fills at the bar open when it gaps through, not at the stop price.
- **ETH is not tradeable for ORB** — WR 9-11%, DD −$35k to −$155k (runs 105-110). RTH only.
- **Half-day / holiday sessions are low quality** — `skip_holidays` detects them by bar count.
- **Low-vol days are ORB's bleeding bucket** — motivates backlog item B (`atr_filter`).
- **Rank by MAR, not PnL** — PnL ranking wrongly crowned the single-lot no-trail config; every
  risk-adjusted lens (PF, MAR, lockbox) prefers the trailed one.
- **In-sample ≠ deployable** — the chandelier proved it. Always let the lockbox decide.
- **⚠️ The lockbox is now OVER-USED** — the reserved last-12-months has been peeked at many times
  (trail, scale-out, sizing, time, side, ES, cap). Each look erodes its held-out value; after this many
  it's effectively an extension of the in-sample set. **The only clean forward test left is LIVE
  performance.** Treat the lockbox MARs as encouraging, not confirmatory. A future clean read needs a
  fresh, never-touched reserved slice.
- **Overlay weights were chosen post-hoc** — morning ×2 / short ×1.5 / 3× cap are a-priori (un-tuned,
  which limits overfit) but the *directions* were picked after seeing the splits. Some selection bias baked in.
- **Slippage may bite the overlay hardest** — the sizing rule concentrates size onto tight-stop (tiny-OR)
  morning trades, which are the *most* fill-sensitive (small range, stop/market entries). Flat 0.25pt
  slippage likely understates cost exactly where the overlay bets biggest — haircut the sized numbers in your head.
- **Short-tilt is regime-untested** — the short edge is measured over a 2010-2026 secular bull, never broken
  down by year/regime. It could concentrate in a few risk-off years. Deploy the *tilt* (not hard short-only),
  and see the open dive below before sizing it up.
- **§4 tables are UNCAPPED; the deployable is CAPPED** — the §4.10/4.11 deploy-stack numbers (full MAR 71.5,
  lockbox 15.0) are the uncapped research frontier. The tradeable rule (§5.6 + the app card) caps at 3× →
  full MAR 96.1 / $590k net. Read §4 as "how big is the edge," §5.6 as "what you'd actually trade."

---

## 9. Open dive (the one worth doing)

**Sub-period / regime stability of the short-side edge.** Everything hinges on shorts carrying the edge
(PF 2.74 vs longs 1.03) — but that's an aggregate over 16 years. Before trusting a short-tilted book, break
the short edge down **by calendar year and by vol regime**: is it steady, or does it live in 2018/2020/2022
risk-off spikes? If the short PF is positive in most years it's structural and safe to tilt; if it's a few
crash years carrying the rest, the tilt is a bet on volatility returning. This is cheap (reuse the deployable
trade log, group by year/VIX-regime) and it's the last thing standing between "measured edge" and "deployable
with confidence." *(Not yet run.)*
